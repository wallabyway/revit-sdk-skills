[INTERFACE] IPointCloudAccess
Full Name: Autodesk.Revit.DB.PointClouds.IPointCloudAccess
Description: An interface that provides functionality for working with an individual Point Cloud.
Remarks: An instance of this interface is obtained from the associated point cloud engine when the engine's CreatePointCloudAccess method is called.An instance of this class will be requested by Revit when drawing the point cloud in the view. For performance reasons, when rendering every frame Revit asks the engine to fetch the necessary points split into multiple batches. The number of batches requested depends on the view: the smaller the projection of the cloud bounding box on the screen the fewer batches Revit requests. Revit assumes that each batch contains points uniformly distributed over the visible part of the cloud ("visible" as defined by the filter). Thus, the points supplied by the engine should not be geometrically distinct (e.g. divided into multiple independent volumes, because at distant zoom levels Revit will only request a few batches and only part of the cloud will be displayed.

  METHODS:
    IPointSetIterator CreatePointSetIterator(PointCloudFilter rFilter, double density, ElementId viewId)
      Description: Implement this method to return an iterator for iterating over blocks of this point cloud.
      @rFilter: The filter used to process cloud points and determine which ones lie with the target volume.
      @density: Desired number of points per unit area. Area is computed in native units of the point cloud. Another iterator, created with the same density and a more restrictive filter, should return a subset of the points returned by this iterator.
      @viewId: The view id for the current view passed as auxiliary information to allow the engine to optimize retrieval of points. If viewId == InvalidElementId, the query is not for a view display operation.
      Returns: The newly created iterator.
    IPointSetIterator CreatePointSetIterator(PointCloudFilter rFilter, ElementId viewId)
      Description: Implement this method to return an iterator for iterating over blocks of this point cloud.
      @rFilter: The filter used to process cloud points and determine which ones lie with the target volume.
      @viewId: The view id for the current view passed as auxiliary information to allow the engine to optimize retrieval of points. If viewId == InvalidElementId, the query is not for a view display operation.
      Returns: The newly created iterator.

      Description: Implement this method so that on successive invocations it will return distinct subsets of points which meet the criterion.
      @rFilter: The filter used to process cloud points and determine which ones lie with the target volume.
      @viewId: The view id for the current view passed as auxiliary information to allow the engine to optimize retrieval of points. If viewId == InvalidElementId, the query is not for a view display operation.
      @buffer: Memory buffer into which the points should be written. The buffer was allocated by Revit and it is guaranteed to be valid for the duration of the call.
      @nBufferSize: The maximum number of CloudPoint objects that may be copied into the buffer.

Full Name: Autodesk.Revit.DB.PointClouds.IPointCloudEngine
Description: An interface that controls the behavior of the link from Revit to a custom Point Cloud Engine.
Remarks: An instance of this interface should be created by the engine provider and registered with the PointCloudEnginesRegistry. The engine may associated with a particular file name extension during registration (for example, Revit supplies a built-in engine for working with files with the extension "rcs" or "rcp"). Alternatively, the engine may be associated with an identifier which is not expected to the be the extension of a particular file.

  METHODS:
    IPointCloudAccess CreatePointCloudAccess(string identifier)

[ABSTRACT CLASS] PointCloudEngineRegistry
Full Name: Autodesk.Revit.DB.PointClouds.PointCloudEngineRegistry
Description: This class supports registration of custom Point Cloud Engines in a Revit session.
Remarks: This class is the start point for engine providers. A custom engine implementation consists of the following: An implementation of IPointCloudEngine registered to Revit via the PointCloudEngineRegistry.An implementation of IPointCloudAccess coded to respond to inquiries from Revit regarding the properties of a single point cloud.An implementation of IPointSetIterator code to return sets of points to Revit when requested.Engine implementations may be file-based or non-file-based: File-based implementations require that each point cloud be mapped to a single file on disk. Revit will allow users to create new point cloud instances in a document directly by selecting point cloud files whose extension matches the engine identifier. These files are treated as external links in Revit and may be reloaded and remapped when necessary from the Manage Links dialog.Non-file-based engine implementations may obtain point clouds from anywhere (e.g. from a database, from a server, or from one part of a larger aggregate file). Because there is no file that the user may select, Revit's user interface will not allow a user to create a point cloud of this type. The engine provider should supply a custom command using PointCloudType.Create() and PointCloudInstance.Create() to create and place point clouds of this type. The Manage Links dialog will show the point clouds of this type, but since there is no file associated to the point cloud, the user cannot manage, reload or remap point clouds of this type.Regardless of the type of engine used, the implementation must supply enough information to Revit to display the contents of the point cloud. There are two ReadPoints methods which must be implemented: IPointCloudAccess.ReadPoints() - this provides a single set of points in a one-time call from Revit. Revit uses this during some display activities including selection prehighlighting. It is also possible for API clients to call this method directly (via PointCloudInstance.GetPoints()).IPointSetIterator.ReadPoints() - this provides a subset of points as a part of a larger iteration of points in the cloud. Revit uses this method during normal display of the point cloud; quantities of points will be requested repeatedly until it obtains enough points or until something in the display changes. The engine implementation must keep track of which points have been returned to Revit during any given point set iteration.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[CLASS] PointIterator
Full Name: Autodesk.Revit.DB.PointClouds.PointIterator
Description: A class used to iterate individual points in a PointCollection.
Remarks: Points may be iterated in two different ways: In the traditional IEnumerable interface, you can iterate the resulting points directly from the PointCollection.In an unsafe interface usable only from C# and C++/CLI, you can get a pointer to the point storage of the collection and access the points directly in memory. Although you must deal with pointers directly, there may be performance improvements when traversing large buffers of points. Regardless of the approach used to obtain the points, the points are reported in the coordinate system of the point cloud. If you need the points in the coordinate system of the model, you will need to transform the point in those coordinates. The most direct way to do this is to obtain the transformation matrix from the PointCloudInstance (GetTransform()), convert the CloudPoint to an XYZ using the implicit conversion operator, and use Transform.OfPoint(XYZ).

      Description: Resets the iterator to the beginning of the collection.
