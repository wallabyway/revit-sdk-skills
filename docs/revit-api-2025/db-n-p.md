[CLASS] NumberingSchema
Full Name: Autodesk.Revit.DB.NumberingSchema
Description: A class to support assigning numbers to elements of a particular kind for the purpose of tagging and scheduling them.
Remarks: Each NumberingSchema controls numbering of elements of one particular kind, typically of the same category such as Rebar or Fabric Reinforcement. Instances of NumberingSchema are also elements and there is always only one of each type in every Revit document. Available types of all built-in numbering schemas are enumerated in NumberingSchemaTypes class. At present, schema elements cannot be manually added, deleted, or copied. Attempts to do so will result in a failure warning and/or exceptions thrown.Elements (e.g. Rebar) belonging to a particular schema (e.g. NumberingSchemaTypes.StructuralNumberingSchemas.Rebar) are organized and numbered in sequences. A sequence is a collection of elements that share the same numbering partition as defined by their respective values of the Partition parameter (NUMBER_PARTITION_PARAM). For a numbering sequence to exist it must contain at least one element. In other words, a sequence is established once there is at least one element of which the partition parameter has a value that differs from other elements (in the same numbering schema). If the last element is removed (deleted or moved to a different sequence) the then empty sequence ceases to exist.Elements get assigned to sequences either upon their creation (based on the then current numbering partition value), or by explicitly modifying the Partition parameter of an element, or by using the AssignElementsToSequence method. It is highly recommended using that method over explicitly changing the Partition parameter, because the methods applies changes to sequences and element numbers immediately, while changed parameters get into effect only after the current transaction is closed.In addition to directly or indirectly changing the Partition parameter of elements, numbering sequences can be reorganized by using methods of the NumberingSchema class. The String) method moves all elements of an existing sequence to a new sequence that does not exist yet in the schema, thus effectively renaming the Partition parameter on all the affected elements. The String) method removes all elements from one sequence and appends them to elements of another existing sequence while applying the matching policy. The method MergeSequences takes elements of all specified sequences and moves them all into a newly created sequence. All the merged elements will be renumbered and matched as needed based on the matching algorithm.Elements in different sequences are numbered independently, meaning that there may be elements with the same number in two sequences even though the elements are different. Likewise, there may be perfectly identical elements in two or more sequences bearing different numbers. However, within each one numbering sequence any two identical elements will always have the same number, while different elements will never have the same number within a numbering sequence. Revit refers to this rule as the matching policy.Enumerable elements are always numbered automatically upon their creation. Each new element will get an incrementally higher number. However, thanks to the matching policy, new elements that match existing elements within the same sequence will get the same number assigned. Elements will keep their assigned numbers as long as it is possible. This means, for example, that if some previously created elements (e.g. Rebar) get deleted, all remaining elements (within the same numbering sequence) will keep their numbers, which may result in gaps in the respective numbering sequence. Gaps can be removed by invoking String) for sequences in which gaps are not desired.Numbers are stored as values of a numbering parameter on each numbered element. The Id of the parameter is obtained by querying the NumberingParameterId property. The value of the number can be obtained by querying the parameter for the respective numbered element. The value is read-only and thus cannot be set; it is always computed based on relations of elements across numbering partitions and the matching policy within the numbering sequence of each element.Even though numbers are always assigned automatically to all elements of a schema, the method Int32) gives the programmer a way to explicitly overwrite a specific number as long as the new number is unique in the numbering sequence. The caller specifies a number to be changed and a new value that is to be applied, providing the value does not exist yet in the same numbering sequence. Although this operation may seem rather limited, it provides the programmer with freedom to change practically any number even if it may be achieved in multiple steps.

[CLASS] OffsetSurface
Full Name: Autodesk.Revit.DB.OffsetSurface
Description: A mathematical representation of an offset surface. Definition of offset surface, quoted from the STEP manual ISO 10303-42:2000(E): This is a procedural definition of a simple offset surface at a normal distance from the originating surface. Distance may be positive, negative, or zero to indicate the preferred side of the surface. The offset surface takes its parametrization directly from that of its basis surface, corresponding points having identical parameter values. The offset surface is parametrized as O(u, v) = S(u, v) + d*N(u, v), where N(u, v) is the oriented unit normal vector of the basis surface S at parameter value (u, v), and d is the signed offset distance.In Revit, we restrict the types of basis surfaces for which an OffsetSurf can be created for the following reasons:The offsets of Plane, CylindricalSurface, ConicalSurface and RevolvedSurface are of the same type as the original surface and they have closed form solutions. So those surfaces are not taken as basis surfaces of the OffsetSurface class. That leaves HermiteSurface and RuledSurface.As a Revit surface, we require the OffsetSurface to be C2 continuous. That implies that the basis surface should be C3 continuous. That is because the OffsetSurface evaluation involves the normal of the basis surface and the order of continuity of the normal is one less than that of the surface.HermiteSurfaces in general are not C3 continuous, even though some of them can be. A RuledSurface will be C3 continuous if its parametric curves are C3 continuous. So we don't allow a HermiteSurface to be a basis surface and allow only RuledSurfaces whose parametric curves are C3 continuous as basis surfaces of the OffsetSurface class.The OffsetSurface class will own a copy of the basis surface and use it for many of its methods, which may implicitly assume that the OffsetSurface and the basis surface have the same envelope. So we keep the envelopes of the OffsetSurf and its basis surface in sync.

[CLASS] Parameter
Full Name: Autodesk.Revit.DB.Parameter
Description: The parameter object contains the value data assigned to that parameter.
Remarks: The piece of data contained within the parameter can be either a Double, Integer, String or ElementId. The parameter object can be retrieved from any Element object using either a built in id, definition object or shared parameter guid. All Elements within Autodesk Revit contain Parameters. These are options that can be accessed in a generic fashion. Revit contains many built in parameter types but users and now developers, via the API, can add their own parameters in the form of shared parameters. The developer should become familiar with the Revit user interface for added and managing parameters and shared parameters before using this API. The user interface components can be found in the following locations: Element Properties dialog, Shared Parameters dialog (available from the File menu), Project Parameters dialog (available from the Settings menu), Family Types dialog (available from the Settings menu when editing a family). There are several relationships between the objects that make up the APIs exposure of parameters. The parameter object contains the data value. Parameter objects can be retrieved from Elements if you know its built-in id, its definition or its shared parameter guid. Each parameter has a definition. New parameters can be added to Elements by adding a ParameterBinding object to the Document object.
