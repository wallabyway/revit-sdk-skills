[CLASS] DatumPlane
Full Name: Autodesk.Revit.DB.DatumPlane
Description: A base class representing a datum surface (level, grid or reference plane) in Autodesk Revit.
Remarks: A DatumPlane represents a 3d surface with finite extents. It can be either a rectangle with arbitrary orientation, or a cylinder whose axis is parallel to the project z-axis. If a datum is visible in a plan or section view, it will be displayed as one or more curves. These curves are determined by the intersection of the datum surface with the cut plane of the view. By default, the extents of these curves reflect the 3d extents of the datum surface. If the surface is a plane, then the extents represent the projection of the surface onto the cut plane. This matters, for example, when viewing a datum plane, really a 3d rectangle, along one of its diagonals. The extents of the curve do not vary with the location of the view, because we use the projection of the rectangle and not the actual intersection. If the surface is a cylinder, then the extents reflect the actual intersection of the surface with the cut plane. In addition, the curves that represent a DatumPlane can be modified on a view specific basis. In this case, the ends of the curve no longer reflect the 3d extents of the datum.

[CLASS] DirectShape
Full Name: Autodesk.Revit.DB.DirectShape
Description: This class is used to store externally created geometric shapes. Primary intended use is for importing shapes from other data formats such as IFC or STEP. A DirectShape object may be assigned a category. That will affect how that object is displayed in Revit.
Remarks: DirectShape is not a replacement for "real" Wall, Roof, Window, etc. It would typically be used where there is not enough information to create, e.g., a Wall, or full functionality of a Wall object is not needed. Some category-specific functionality may be available. If you need to modify a shape held by a DirectShape object, use Revit Geometry API, and then store the modified shape back to the DirectShape object.

[CLASS] DirectShapeLibrary
Full Name: Autodesk.Revit.DB.DirectShapeLibrary
Description: DirectShapeLibrary is used to store pre-created geometry for further referencing via the definition/instance mechanism. It is not persistent: the scope of a library object is usually a single data creation session. DirectShape::createGeometryInstance and DirectShape::CreateElementInstance will use the current DirectShapeLibrary to look up the definitions. store a collection of GNodes as definition end class DirectShapeDefinition
Remarks: There are two ways to add a definition to the library. The first is to add the definition as an array of geometry objects. A DirectShape created as an instance of that definition will hold a copy of predefined geometry, transformed as requested. If the definition was added as a DirectShapeType, a DirectShape object created as an instance of that definition will reference the type. Its geometry would be an instance of type geometry.
