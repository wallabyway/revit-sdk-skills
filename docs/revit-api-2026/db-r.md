[CLASS] ReferenceIntersector
Full Name: Autodesk.Revit.DB.ReferenceIntersector
Description: A class used to find and return elements that intersect a ray created from an origin point and direction.
Remarks: An instance of this class can be constructed to return any 3D geometric element that intersects the ray created by the origin and direction, or to return a subset of elements based on filtering and flags. The caller can opt to filter the results using an ElementFilter, or by applying a specific list of acceptable elements. The caller can also specify the type of object to be returned, which might be whole elements, geometry objects, or a combination. In all cases the caller is required to supply a 3D view for evaluation; the view and visibility settings on the input view will determine if a particular element is returned (for example, hidden elements will never be returned by this tool, nor will elements whose geometry is outside the section box of the view).The class is configured so that a single instance can be constructed and used for multiple evaluations of different rays. The results of the evaluation are not preserved between invocations on the same ReferenceIntersector.The class also offers an option to return element results encountered in Revit Links. When the FindReferencesInRevitLinks flag is set, the results may include elements in the host document and in any RevitLinkInstance encountered, depending on the other flags set. See the remarks for FindReferencesInRevitLinks for details on how the flags affect the results obtained from links.

[CLASS] RevisionCloud
Full Name: Autodesk.Revit.DB.RevisionCloud
Description: A RevisionCloud is a graphical "cloud" that can be displayed on a view or sheet to indicate where revisions in the model have occurred.
Remarks: RevisionClouds are view specific and can be created in most graphical views, except 3D. Unlike most Elements, RevisionClouds may be added directly to a ViewSheet. Each RevisionCloud is associated with one Revision. When a RevisionCloud is visible on a ViewSheet (either because it is directly placed on that ViewSheet or because it is visible in a View placed on the ViewSheet), any revision schedules displayed on the ViewSheet will automatically include the Revision associated with the RevisionCloud.Note also that when a RevisionCloud is created in a ViewLegend, it is treated as a legend representation of what a RevisionCloud looks like rather than as an actual indication of a change to the model. As a result, RevisionClouds in ViewLegends will not affect the contents of revision schedules.RevisionClouds are created from a collection of sketched curves. Each curve will have a series of "cloud bumps" drawn along it to form the appearance of a cloud. There is no requirement that the curves form closed loops.

[CLASS] RevitLinkOperations
Full Name: Autodesk.Revit.DB.RevitLinkOperations
Description: This class is used to extend the IExternalResourceServer interface with methods to support operations specifically related to Revit links.
Remarks: The class owns single-method interfaces which are used as callbacks to perform specific operations on Revit link external resources.An empty RevitLinkOperations instance is passed to an IExternalResourceServer (inside an ExternalResourceServerExtensions object) via the GetTypeSpecificServerOperations method. The server provider can then add their own implemented interface objects to the RevitLinkOperations, thus making them available to Revit to use as callbacks.Supporting these additional, type-specific operations is not absolutely required, but is strongly recommended in order for users to be able to perform all the same operations they would with locally-accessed Revit links.
